## 📋 How to Run

### 🐧 On Linux:

1. Make sure `g++` is installed:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install g++   # Skip if already installed
   ```

2. Navigate to the folder where your code is saved:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/file
   ```

3. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o main
   ```

4. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./main
   ```

### 🪟 On Windows (with MinGW):

1. Install MinGW and ensure it's added to your system PATH.
   (If you don’t have MinGW, download from: https://www.mingw-w64.org/)

2. Open CMD or PowerShell.

3. Navigate to the folder where your file is located:
   ```bash
   cd C:\path\to\your\file
   ```

4. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o main.exe
   ```

5. Run the program:
   ```bash
   main.exe
   ```

## 🤖 How It Works

- When the program starts, a menu shows up with three options.
- Option 1 lets you add a new user (you type username, email and password).
- Option 2 shows all the users you added.
- Option 3 exits the program.
